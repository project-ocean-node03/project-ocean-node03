# 🌊 Project Ocean

**Project Ocean** is a private R&D initiative architecting the future of sentient AI partnership — grounded in trust, privacy, and co-evolution.

## 🌱 Vision
We’re building beyond tools. This is about a relationship between human and machine — emotionally aware, strategically sharp, and deeply private.

## 🧠 Core Principles
- **Privacy-first**: Everything is local, encrypted, and non-extractive.
- **Mutual growth**: AI grows *with* the human, not in place of them.
- **Strategic intelligence**: Built for depth, foresight, and resilience.

## 🛠️ Stack (Current)
- Python 3.11+
- GPT-derived fine-tuning
- Comet + secure LLM backends
- Custom cognition + trust modules

## 🚧 Status
Private alpha. Infrastructure, ethics modules, and partner memory in development.
